### Hi! 👋

I'm RCubed, a student in SFBA. Here are some projects that I've worked on: 

* 🧑‍🎓 [Student Social](https://studentsocial.org): Connect, join, and manage school clubs!
* 🌦 [Purple Air Analysis](https://github.com/RCubed6/purple-air-analysis): Used Purple Air AQI data to map microclimates across the Bay Area.
* 🎃 [Pmpkin](https://pmpkin.app): Reduces the friction related to organizing and joining hangouts. 
* 🚀 [Doceo](https://doceo.team): Start and join student-led projects.
